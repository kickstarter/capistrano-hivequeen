== HiveQueen client

Makes your capistrano scripts aware of HiveQueen environments.

=== Installation

In your Gemfile:

    group :development do
      gem 'capistrano/hivequeen', :require => nil
    end

And in your config/deploy.rb:

    set :hivequeen_endpoint, "http://your.hivequeen.com"
    require 'hivequeen_client'

=== Options

[az]
  Restrict commands to servers in an availability zone:

    cap staging app:start -s az=us-east-1a

[branch]
  Use a specific branch, rather than the default for the Hivequeen environment:

    cap staging deploy -s branch=some_feature
